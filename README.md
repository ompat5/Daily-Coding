# 🚀 Daily Dose of Data Drills

Welcome to the land of loops, joins, and the occasional existential crisis. This repo is where I sharpen my data science weapons every day by slaying one (or more) LeetCode and StrataScratch problem(s).

> 📈 Getting better at data science isn't a sprint—it's a daily SQL jog followed by a Python sprint.

I'm doing this to level up my problem-solving, keep my brain caffeinated ☕, and prepare for the day someone throws a left-outer join at me in a job interview!

This README updates daily with links to the problems I’ve solved. Click on a link to view my solution (you'll need an account on the respective site).

This is a marathon, not a sprint. Or maybe more like a triathlon — SQL, Python, and crying. Let’s get better one problem at a time 💪.
